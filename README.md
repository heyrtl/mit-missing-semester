# MIT Missing Semester - Lecture 1

## Exercises Completed
- Created bash script `semester` that curls missing.csail.mit.edu
- Made it Executable with `chmod`
- Extracted last modified date to `last-modified.txt`

## What I Learned
- Basic shell commands (`mkdir`, `touch`, `chmod`)
- File permisions and execution
- Piping and redirection
- How to read `man` pages (even when they are cryptic)

## Notes
Got stuck on exercise 9 for an hour and exercise 10 for 2 hours. Learned that MacOS stat uses different flags than Linux. Figured it our through Google + StackOverFlow instead of AI.
